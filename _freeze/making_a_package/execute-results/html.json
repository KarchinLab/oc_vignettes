A package is a module which defines module installation and job parameters. Packages are always the best choice when you want to automate an analysis workflow that you will repeat many times.\n\nChoosing the right approach can significantly impact the efficiency of the analysis. Below we explore the pros of using a package versus individual annotators.\n\n### Pros of using a package\n\n1.  Comprehensive Analysis: Packages include multiple annotators, providing a more comprehensive analysis of variants.\n\n2.  Ease of Use: Packages are pre-configured, making them easier to setup without needing to manually select individual annotators.\n\n3.  Consistency: Using a package ensures consistent application of annotations across different analyses.\n\n## How to make a package\n\nFor example, if you use the below process often:\n\n-   Install SIFT, BayesDel,CADD Exome, VEST4, PrimateAI,GERP++,FATHMM, and REVEL modules.\n-   Annotate with the modules.\n-   Filter for Pathogenic variants only.\n-   Update layout to user preferences.\n-   Make csv and excel reports.\n-   Share your package with the OpenCRAVAT community\n\n## Package Build Process\n\nClick on each box in the flowchart below to jump to that part of the build process.\n\n\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n  A[Install Modules] --> B\n  click A \"#install-modules\"\n  B[Annotate with Modules] --> C\n  click B \"#annotate-with-modules\"\n  C[Filter] -->  D\n  click C \"#filter\"\n  D[Layout] -->E\n  click D \"#layout\"\n  E[Export Results] --> E\n  click E \"#results\"\n  F[Share Package]\n  \n```\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a package module requires the following:\n\n## Open your local installation of OpenCRAVAT\n\nBefore we create a new package, load OpenCRAVAT and make sure the packages we need are installed:\n\n\n\n\n\n```{bash}\noc gui\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n![Screenshot of Terminal to Run OpenCRAVAT GUI](images/oc-ocgui.png)\n\n## Install Modules\n\nMake sure the annotators you would like to include in the package have been installed from the store.\n\n![Screenshot of Store](images/oc-store.png)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Annotate with Modules\n\nFor this tutorial we will use the Example HGVS variants included in the OpenCRAVAT software. Choose the HGVS button under the variants tab. Next choose the annotators you would like to include in your package.\n\nWe will focus on variant effect predictor annotators and choose the following: SIFT, BayesDel,CADD Exome, VEST4, PrimateAI, GERP++, FATHMM, and REVEL.\n\n![Next you will scroll down and select the ANNOTATE button.](images/oc-jobs-package.png)\n\n![](images/oc-annotate-button.png)\n\n![](images/oc-package-job.png)\n\n## Filter\n\nTo begin filtering, click the FILTER tab and navigate to the section entitled variant properties.\n\n### Query Builder\n\nThe Query Builder allows you to create custom filters. Click the Query Builder header under the variant properties tab to begin.\n\nFirst, hover your mouse within the rounded brackets. A plus sign will appear to the far left. Click the plus sign\n\n## Layout\n\n",
